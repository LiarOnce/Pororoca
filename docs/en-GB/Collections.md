# Collections

A Pororoca collection holds your collection variables, environments and HTTP requests, all together in a single place.

## Creating

To create a new collection, go to the top menu, select "File", then "New collection". Your new collection will be visible on the left panel. You can create as many collections as you want.

## Import and export

Collections can also be imported and exported from files. Check the [Export and Import](ExportAndImport.md) page.

## Saved location

The collections that you create are saved in the `PororocaUserData` folder, located along the executable. When you close the application, all collections are saved.

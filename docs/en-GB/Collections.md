# Collections

A Pororoca collection holds your collection variables, environments and HTTP requests, all together in a single place.

## Creating

To create a new collection, go to the top menu, select "File", then "New collection". Your new collection will be visible on the left panel. You can create as many collections as you want.

## Renaming

To rename your collection, click on the pencil icon, at the top right. This will enable the collection name for edition.

## Import and export

Collections can also be imported and exported from files. Check the [Export and Import](ExportAndImport.md) page.

## Saved location

The collections that you create are saved in the `PororocaUserData` folder. When you close the application, all collections are saved.

If you are running an installed on Windows version, the `PororocaUserData` folder is located in `C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Pororoca\`. For other platforms and for the portable version, the folder is located alongside the executable.

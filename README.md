* Collections and environments can be exported together in a single file.

* Fast startup time.
* Open-source.

*Note*: Support for HTTP/2 requires Linux or Windows 10 and later, and support for HTTP/3 requires Linux or Windows 11 and later.

### HTTP/3 and traceability

HTTP/3 uses the QUIC transport protocol and there are some traceability concerns about it. It might not be a problem on internal network communications and for most business applications, though. There is an interesting article about it [here](https://svs.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/publications/2019/2019-02-26-Sy-PET_Symposium-A_QUIC_Look_at_Web_Tracking.pdf).

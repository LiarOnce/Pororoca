* Secret variables.
* Collections and environments can be exported together in a single file.

* WebSockets.
* Fast startup time.
* Free and open-source.

Check the [documentation](https://pororoca.io/docs/) to know more.

*Note*: On Windows, support for HTTP/2 requires Windows 10 or later. Support for HTTP/3 requires Linux or Windows 11 and later. HTTP/3 is still experimental.

### HTTP/3 and privacy

HTTP/3 uses the QUIC transport protocol and there are some privacy concerns about it. It might not be a problem on internal network communications and for most business applications, though. There is an interesting article about it [here](https://svs.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/publications/2019/2019-02-26-Sy-PET_Symposium-A_QUIC_Look_at_Web_Tracking.pdf).
